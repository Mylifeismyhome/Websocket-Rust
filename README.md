Websocket-Rust

This repository provides a Rust wrapper around a C-based WebSocket implementation, exposing it as a shared library with a C-compatible API. It enables projects written in C, C++, or other FFI-friendly languages to easily integrate WebSocket capabilities powered by Rust.
üß© Structure

This project uses a Git submodule:

    Websocket: A C-based WebSocket implementation.

üì¶ Features

    Wraps a C WebSocket library with Rust.

    Exposes a C-compatible API via a shared library (.so, .dll, .dylib).

    Uses bindgen to generate C bindings for Rust.

    Enables FFI-friendly WebSocket communication.

üöÄ Getting Started
1. Clone with submodules

git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Mylifeismyhome/Websocket-Rust.git
cd Websocket-Rust

2. Install Prerequisites

You will need the following installed:

    Rust and Cargo: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

    LLVM + Clang: https://llvm.org/

    Git

On Ubuntu/Debian:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install llvm clang build-essential git

On macOS:

brew install llvm

    Make sure LLVM is in your PATH:

    export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH"

On Windows:

    Install LLVM via https://releases.llvm.org/ or:

choco install llvm

    Install Rust via https://rustup.rs

    Ensure cargo and clang are in your system PATH.

3. Build
On Windows:

build.bat

This compiles the Rust code and generates a C header using bindgen.
On macOS / Linux:

chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh

Same as above‚Äîbuilds the shared library and generates the C header.
üèóÔ∏è Output

After building, you'll find:

    target/release/websocket.dll (Windows)

    target/release/libwebsocket.so (Linux)

    target/release/libwebsocket.dylib (macOS)

    websocket.h ‚Äî C header for the public API

üîß Using the Library in C/C++

Include the header and link against the compiled shared library in your C/C++ project.
Example C usage:

#include "websocket.h"

int main() {
    ws_start("ws://echo.websocket.org");
    // your logic here
    return 0;
}

    Ensure your compiler knows where to find the header and library:

        On Linux/macOS, you might need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH.

        On Windows, make sure the .dll is in the same directory as your executable or in your PATH.

‚ùì Troubleshooting

    If bindgen fails, make sure LLVM and Clang are correctly installed and accessible via PATH.

    On Windows, use the MSVC toolchain and developer command prompt if needed.
