# Websocket-Rust

This repository provides a Rust wrapper around a C-based WebSocket implementation, exposing it as a shared library with a C-compatible API. It enables projects written in C, C++, or other FFI-friendly languages to easily integrate WebSocket capabilities powered by Rust.

## 🧩 Structure

This project uses a Git submodule:

- [`Websocket`](https://github.com/Mylifeismyhome/Websocket): A C-based WebSocket implementation.

## 📦 Features

- Wraps a C WebSocket library with Rust.
- Exposes a C-compatible API via a shared library (`.so`, `.dll`, `.dylib`).
- Uses [`bindgen`](https://docs.rs/bindgen/latest/bindgen/) to generate C bindings for Rust.
- Enables FFI-friendly WebSocket communication.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone with submodules

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Mylifeismyhome/Websocket-Rust.git
cd Websocket-Rust
```

### 2. Install Prerequisites

You will need the following installed:

- [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [LLVM + Clang](https://llvm.org/)
- Git

#### On Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install llvm clang build-essential git
```

#### On macOS:

```bash
brew install llvm
```

Make sure LLVM is in your PATH:

```bash
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH"
```

#### On Windows:

Install LLVM via [releases.llvm.org](https://releases.llvm.org/) or:

```bash
choco install llvm
```

Install Rust via [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)

Ensure `cargo` and `clang` are in your system PATH.

### 3. Build

#### On Windows:

```bash
build.bat
```

This compiles the Rust code and generates a C header using `bindgen`.

#### On macOS / Linux:

```bash
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

Same as above—builds the shared library and generates the C header.

## 🏗️ Output

After building, you'll find:

- `target/release/websocket.dll` (Windows)
- `target/release/libwebsocket.so` (Linux)
- `target/release/libwebsocket.dylib` (macOS)
- `websocket.h` — C header for the public API

## 🔧 Using the Library in C/C++

Include the header and link against the compiled shared library in your C/C++ project.

### Example C usage:

```c
#include "websocket.h"

int main() {
    ws_start("ws://echo.websocket.org");
    // your logic here
    return 0;
}
```

Ensure your compiler knows where to find the header and library:

- On Linux/macOS, you might need to set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
- On Windows, make sure the `.dll` is in the same directory as your executable or in your `PATH`.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

- If `bindgen` fails, make sure LLVM and Clang are correctly installed and accessible via PATH.
- On Windows, use the MSVC toolchain and developer command prompt if needed.
