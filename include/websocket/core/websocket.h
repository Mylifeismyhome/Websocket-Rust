/**
 * @mainpage Websocket Library
 *
 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * This WebSocket Library offers a straightforward C++ and C API. It can be utilized as either a shared/static library or included directly in projects that support at least C++11. The library includes an example demonstrating how to set up either a server or client endpoint.
 *
 * It facilitates WebSocket communication in both secure and unsecured modes, making it suitable for real-time, web-based applications.
 *
 * @section features_sec Features
 * - Support for both client and server endpoints
 * - Availability of C and C++ APIs
 * - Support for both secure (SSL) and unsecured communication
 * - Ability to process WebSocket frames, including encoding and decoding them
 *
 * @section usage_sec Usage
 *
 * This example illustrates how to use the WebSocket library by referring to the example implementation in
 * the file `example.cpp`. In this file, you will find:
 *
 * - Initialize WebSocket settings with `ws_settings_init` and clean up using `ws_settings_destroy`.
 * - Create a WebSocket context using the `c_websocket` class or, for the C API, use `websocket_create` and `websocket_destroy` for cleanup.
 * - Manage connections by handling events such as `on_open`, `on_close`, `on_frame`, and `on_error` with the `c_websocket::on` method or `websocket_on` for the C API.
 * - Set up the WebSocket using the `c_websocket::setup` method or `websocket_setup` for the C API.
 * - Bind to an interface with `c_websocket::bind` or `websocket_bind` for the C API.
 * - Open a connection to an endpoint using `c_websocket::open` or `websocket_open` for the C API.
 * - In the main loop, call `c_websocket::operate` or `websocket_operate` for the C API until it returns false.
 * - Create frames using the `c_ws_frame` class or `websocket_frame_create` for the C API, and clean up with `websocket_frame_destroy`.
 * - Push payloads to frames with the `c_ws_frame::push` method or `websocket_frame_push` for the C API.
 * - Emit frames using the `c_websocket::emit` method or `websocket_frame_emit` for the C API.
 *
 * For a complete implementation, please refer to the `example.cpp` file.

/**
 * @brief Websocket skeleton
 *
 * RFC6455
 *
 * The `c_websocket` class provides an interface for handling WebSocket
 * communication. It allows binding to IP addresses and ports, opening
 * file descriptors, emitting frames, and registering event listeners.
 * This class acts as a base for implementing WebSocket servers or clients,
 * facilitating real-time, bidirectional communication over a single TCP
 * connection.
 *
 * ## Features
 * - **Binding**: Bind to a specific IP address and port to listen for incoming
 *   WebSocket connections.
 * - **Opening Connections**: Open a connection to a specified host and port.
 * - **Emitting Frames**: Send WebSocket frames through a specified file descriptor.
 * - **Event Handling**: Register callback functions to respond to various WebSocket
 *   events, such as connection opening, closing, frame reception, and error handling.
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * To use the `c_websocket` class:
 * 1. Create an instance of the class.
 * 2. Bind to a desired IP address and port using the `bind` method.
 * 3. Open a connection to a remote WebSocket server using the `open` method.
 * 4. Register event handlers using the `on` method to handle WebSocket events.
 * 5. Call the `operate` method in a loop to manage communication and event processing.
 * 6. Use the `emit` method to send frames to connected clients or servers.
 * 7. Close the connection with the `close` method when done.
 *
 * This interface can be implemented by derived classes to provide specific
 * functionalities for different WebSocket applications.
